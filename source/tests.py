        find while doing a project was a tutorial on how to mock a database for testing.
        I believe a similar method can be used for pytest as well.
        When doing continual 
        testing as the software is developed or improved upon, testing has to be done to ensure expected functionality.
        
        There may be methods or functions that can alter the data in the database. 
        When testing these functions, it’s best to use a separate database. 
        It’s most definitely not recommended to use the production database while testing.
        
        When testing is automated it’s not possible to manually change the database 
        that each function is using. So, it’s necessary to patch in the test database to the production database. 
        For that, we use the patch function available in the mock package. This is available in the Python standard"""
